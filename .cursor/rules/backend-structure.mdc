# Backend Structure Guide

The backend is located in [src/worker/](mdc:src/worker) and runs on Cloudflare Workers using Hono and tRPC.

## Main API Routes
- [routes/calories.ts](mdc:src/worker/routes/calories.ts): Handles food log CRUD operations and calorie estimation via AI
- [routes/index.ts](mdc:src/worker/routes/index.ts): Combines all API routes into the main appRouter

## Database
- [db/schema.ts](mdc:src/worker/db/schema.ts): Defines the schema for food logs (MVP may use in-memory or SQLite via Drizzle)

## AI Integration
- The `analyze` endpoint in [calories.ts](mdc:src/worker/routes/calories.ts) uses Cloudflare Workers AI to estimate calories from food descriptions

## Auth
- [lib/auth.ts](mdc:src/worker/lib/auth.ts): Handles authentication/session logic (may be stubbed or optional for MVP)
