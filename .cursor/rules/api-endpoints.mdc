# API Endpoints Guide

The backend exposes the following main endpoints for the calorie tracker, implemented in @src/worker/routes/food.ts:

- `analyze` (query): Estimates calories from a food description using Cloudflare Workers AI
- `createFoodLog` (mutation): Adds a new food log entry
- `getFoodLogs` (query): Retrieves all food logs for the current user
- `updateFoodLog` (mutation): Updates the calories for a food log
- `deleteFoodLog` (mutation): Deletes a food log
- `getDailySummary` (query): Returns the total calories and log count for the current day

These endpoints are accessed from the frontend via tRPC (see [trpc-client.ts](mdc:src/react-app/lib/trpc-client.ts)).
